## Add Maps To A Website With Leaflet

[Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) is an open source JavaScript package for adding interactive maps into your app or webpage. It has a small footprint yet is fully featured, and has a thriving community of [plugins](https://leafletjs.com/plugins.html) to choose from.

The [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) package provides React bindings for the Leaflet package. In this post I demonstrate how to create a map component with address search functionality using the React Leaflet package and [Geoapify](https://www.geoapify.com/) API.

Through this process, you will learn how to add arbitrary HTML elements as custom controls to a React Leaflet map.

## Getting Started With React Leaflet

Let's begin by rendering a basic map in our React app. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm i leaflet react-leaflet
npm i -D @types/leaflet @types/react-leaflet
```

At the time of writing these are the package versions used:

| Package                         | Version |
| ------------------------------- | ------: |
| react                           |  18.0.0 |
| react-dom                       |  18.0.0 |
| leaflet                         |   1.9.3 |
| react-leaflet                   |   4.2.0 |
| @geoapify/geocoder-autocomplete |   1.5.1 |

The [React Leaflet Installation Guide](https://react-leaflet.js.org/docs/start-installation/) directs us to setup the base Leaflet package first. That involves setting up the stylesheet.

Visit the [Leaflet Quick Start Guide](https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/) to get the latest version of the `<link>` tag and add it to the `<head>` of your page:

```tsx
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.3/dist/leaflet.css"
  integrity="sha256-kLaT2GOSpHechhsozzB+flnD+zUyjE2LlfWPgU04xyI="
  crossOrigin=""
/>
```

With that in place let's create a `Map.tsx` component like so:

```tsx
// Map.tsx
import { MapContainer, Marker, Popup, TileLayer } from "react-leaflet";

const Map = () => {
  return (
    <MapContainer className="h-80" center={[51.505, -0.09]} zoom={13}>
      <TileLayer
        attribution='&copy; <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'
        url="https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png"
      />
      <Marker position={[51.505, -0.09]}>
        <Popup>
          A pretty CSS3 popup. <br /> Easily customizable.
        </Popup>
      </Marker>
    </MapContainer>
  );
};

export default Map;
```

This gives us a basic Leaflet map centered on London, England. It comes with a zoom control element and click and drag functionality. We also added a map marker that displays a pop up when clicked.

Make sure to set a height on the component. In this example I styled it with Tailwind CSS: `className="h-80"`.

<LeafletMap showStaticMarker={true} />

## Creating A Custom Control

Now lets add an arbitrary HTML element as a control overlay to the Leaflet map instance. Create a `CustomControl.tsx` component like so:

```tsx
// CustomControl.tsx
import { Control, DomUtil } from "leaflet";
import { useMap } from "react-leaflet";
import { useEffect } from "react";

export const LeafletCustomControl = () => {
  const mapContainer = useMap();

  const CustomControl = Control.extend({
    options: {
      position: "topright",
    },
    onAdd: function () {
      const el = DomUtil.create("div");

      el.className = "h-16 w-16 bg-pink-600";
      el.innerText = "Click me!";

      el.onclick = function () {
        alert("Hello from a custom Leaflet control!");
      };

      return el;
    },
    onRemove: function () {
      return;
    },
  });

  const customControl = new CustomControl();

  useEffect(() => {
    mapContainer.addControl(customControl);
  }, []);

  return null;
};
```

Add it as a child component of `<MapContainer>`. You should see a pink square in the top right corner of the map, with a click event handler.

```tsx
// Map.tsx
<MapContainer>
  <TileLayer />
  <CustomControl />
</MapContainer>
```

<LeafletMap showBasicControl={true} />

Let's breakdown what is happening:

- A [Leaflet control](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html#control) is an instance of the `L.Control` class that implements the `onAdd` and `onRemove` methods.
- The `useMap` hook returns the root `<MapContainer>` reference for any of its child components.
- The `L.Control.extend` method returns a class that implements the `L.Control` type, and we define the position as `topright`.
- Within the `onAdd` callback, we create an `HTMLDivElement`, add styles and event handlers to the element, and return it from the function.
- We instantiate an instance of our custom control.
- Inside a `useEffect` hook we use the `addControl` method to add the instance of our custom control to our `<MapContainer>` reference.
- The `CustomControl.tsx` component itself returns `null`.

We now have a React component that can be used with any React Leaflet map by adding it as a child component. More importantly, the control element will be rendered on top of the map tiles, which makes for an intuitive user experience.

## Address Search With Geoapify

Let's make something useful now. We will leverage the [Geoapify Address Autocomplete API](https://www.geoapify.com/address-autocomplete) to add address search functionality to our map. The free tier generously provides 3000 credits for use daily. We will use the [Geocoder Autocomplete](https://github.com/geoapify/geocoder-autocomplete) package which handles making API calls, and rendering of the search suggestions on the page for us.

<aside className="info">
  There is a [react-geocoder-autocomplete](https://github.com/geoapify/react-geocoder-autocomplete)
  package available as well. We will *not* be using this package. Because the Leaflet custom control
  API works by returning an `HTMLElement` from the `onAdd` method, as shown in the example above
  using an `HTMLDivElement`.
</aside>

Before we proceed, you will need to visit the [Geoapify](https://myprojects.geoapify.com/login) platform and register so you can obtain an API key.

Next, install the package for the address search element:

```bash
npm i @geoapify/geocoder-autocomplete
```

Import the stylesheet into your `globals.css` file:

```css
@import "@geoapify/geocoder-autocomplete/styles/minimal.css";
```

Create an `AddressSearch.tsx` component as follows:

```tsx
// AddressSearch.tsx
import { GeocoderAutocomplete } from "@geoapify/geocoder-autocomplete";
import { Control, DomUtil } from "leaflet";
import { useMap } from "react-leaflet";
import { useEffect } from "react";

export const AddressSearch = () => {
  const map = useMap();

  const SearchControl = Control.extend({
    options: {
      position: "topright",
    },
    onAdd: function () {
      const el = DomUtil.create("div");

      el.className = "relative minimal";

      el.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
        e.stopPropagation();
      });

      el.addEventListener("dblclick", (e) => {
        e.stopPropagation();
      });

      const autocomplete = new GeocoderAutocomplete(el, "API_KEY", {
        placeholder: "Enter an address",
      });

      autocomplete.on("select", (location) => {
        const { lat, lon } = location.properties;
        map.setView({ lat, lng: lon }, map.getZoom());
      });

      return el;
    },
    onRemove: function (map: Map) {
      return;
    },
  });

  const searchControl = new SearchControl();

  useEffect(() => {
    map.addControl(searchControl);
  }, []);

  return null;
};
```

Let's add the component as a child of the `<MapContainer>` component to use the control:

```tsx
// Map.tsx
<MapContainer>
  <TileLayer />
  <AddressSearch />
</MapContainer>
```

<aside className="caution mb-5">
  Depending on the popularity of this post, there might not be credits remaining on the Geoapify
  free tier. Please use sparingly =]
</aside>
<LeafletMap showAddressSearch={true} />

The `GeocoderAutocomplete` class accepts as arguments an `HTMLElement`, the API key, and some optional configurations. Instantiating the class will add the address search component as a child of the `HTMLElement` supplied as the argument.

Like in the previous example, we add styles to the `HTMLElement`. The `minimal` CSS class is from the stylesheet provided by the Geocoder Autocomplete package. The `HTMLElement` container must have a CSS display property of `relative` or `absolute`.

The Autocomplete component can [listen to a number of events](https://github.com/geoapify/geocoder-autocomplete#geocoder-autocomplete-events). We use the `select` event to change the map view when a suggestion is selected.

<aside className="info">
The `click` and `dblclick` event handlers are used to stop click events bubbling up to the root `<MapContainer>` element. You might want this behaviour if you have `click` event handlers on the `<MapContainer>` component itself. For example, the map could have an event handler that creates a `<Marker>` on the clicked location, then sets the map view to that location.
</aside>

## Optimization

Let's wrap the initialization of the control with the `useMemo` hook to improve performance.

Return `new SearchControl()` from `useMemo`, so that it is available in our `useEffect` hook:

```tsx
// AddressSearch.tsx
export const AddressSearch = () => {
  const map = useMap();

  const searchControl = useMemo(() => {
    const SearchControl = Control.extend({
      options: {
        position: "topright",
      },
      onAdd: function () {
        const el = DomUtil.create("div");

        el.className = "relative minimal round-borders";

        el.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
          e.stopPropagation();
        });

        el.addEventListener("dblclick", (e) => {
          e.stopPropagation();
        });

        const autocomplete = new GeocoderAutocomplete(el, "API_KEY", {
          placeholder: "Enter an address",
        });

        autocomplete.on("select", (location) => {
          const { lat, lon } = location.properties;
          map.setView({ lat, lng: lon }, map.getZoom());
        });

        return el;
      },
      onRemove: function () {
        return;
      },
    });

    return new SearchControl();
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    map.addControl(searchControl);
  }, [map, searchControl]);

  return null;
};
```
