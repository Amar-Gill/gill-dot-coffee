		<p>
			I was born and raised in Toronto, Ontario. As a son to immigrant parents, I understand the
			value of hard work.
		</p>
		<p>
			I earned a Bachelor of Engineering from McMaster University, and worked in the Architecure,
			Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry for 5 years.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 2019 I quit my job and committed to learning software development full time. I attended the
			Next Academy Web Development Bootcamp in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Afterwards I backpacked
			through the region for some time. It was an unforgettable experience. Upon returning home I
			began my new life as a professional developer.
